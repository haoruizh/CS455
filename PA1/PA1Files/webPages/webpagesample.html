        <P> For this assignment, we want to develop a web server that handles one HTTP request at a time. Your web server will accept and
            parse an HTTP request message, get the requested file from the server’s file system (you must
            create this file as well, see below), create an HTTP response message consisting of the requested
            file preceded by appropriate message header lines, and send the response directly to the client. </P>
        
        <P> If the requested file is not present in the server, your server will send an HTTP “404 Not Found”
        message back to the client.</P>
